My mom calls getting rid of clutter "stuff-ectomy" and it really does feel like removing a useless, even poisonous, thing from your life to look at a pile of clothes you've purged from your closet or the extra space under your bathroom sink after you've pulled out all a bunch of untouched products and think, "Look at how much cleaner everything is!"

Well, how awesome would it be to not only feel good about clearing out the junk, but to earn some money from it?

Fairly awesome.

Here are five ways that my husband and I make money from stuff we don't need any more.

1\. Sell your old clothes. We have second-hand stores in our area like Plato's Closet that will pay you for your clothes, as long as they are in good condition and from a well-known brand. ThredUp is a new website that works on a similar principle, and they're great because they will donate any clothes that don't meet their guidelines, so nothing goes to waste. For more information, visit \_\_\_

2\. Sell old books at Cash4books.com

3\. Recycle old electronics. There are a lot of sites out there that will buy your old cell phones, computers, mp3 players, GPS, etc. and some of them will pay shipping too. My favorite two are YouRenew.com and Gazelle.com

4\. Rent out your car. My husband currently doesn't need his car on a regular basis because he uses the train to commute. Instead of selling his car and losing the option of having a second car when we need it, we decided to rent the car out using Turo. Turo has great insurance, vets people who want to rent cars, and takes care of all the scheduling. Because we live close to a main public transit line, a lot of people from out of town rent our car and just take a train or bus from the airport to us. We usually more than pay for our monthly car payment and we can always pull the car out of the system to use it ourselves if we need it!

5\. Sell toys and collectibles. One person's trash is another person's treasure. I was surprised when I first visited Ebay's "What to sell" page how much people are paying for toys. Action figures, lego sets, and American Girl dolls are on their "hot" items list. Of course, the better the condition of the item, the more you will get, but there's definitely a market for used toys too. Sites like craigslist.com can also be great places to sell. Wherever you sell, be aware of scammers and follow the site's recommendations to keep the process safe.
