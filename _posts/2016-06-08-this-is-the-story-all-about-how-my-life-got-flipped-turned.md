  a little too round, and a lot too red, but she is also gorgeous. Everyone who

This picture is of me. Hi. It's also of that one red tulip popping up and waving around in a sea of tulips not quite like her. She's a little too tall, a little too round, and a lot too red, but she is also gorgeous. Everyone who passed this field while I stood there paused to smile at the tulip sticking up above the rest, proudly blooming the wrong color.

Of course, she wasn't the wrong color. She was always going to be big, round and red, and it was never her fault that she got planted in the yellow field instead of the red one you can see far in the distance. Someone else's mistake meant that she ended up here, surrounded by friends very different than she is, but this little tulip gets to make people smile in a way she never would have if she'd been stuck where she "belonged".

As a painfully shy and introverted person, I tend to feel out of place if I'm anywhere that is not my house. If, horror of horrors, I find myself in a social situation, I do my best to blend into the background. I'll bend my knees or lean against something so that I'm not taller than the people around me. I'll smile, mirror the body language of nearby people so I don't look happier, sadder, less excited than anyone else. When pulled into a conversation, I respond when spoken to, but do my best to keep other people talking about themselves so that they won't need to find out how stupid weird I am. It usually works, and I get to float through the required social activity without standing out too much until I can find an appropriate time to slip out, sigh in relief, and get back to the safety of my house.

Lately that hasn't felt like enough, and I've found myself just ignoring invitations whenever possible. When I exert all my energy trying to be exactly average, there's not much left over for being me. I feel like I imagine this red tulip would feel if she tried to pretend to be a yellow tulip. I have to bury myself way down among my peers to avoid being spotted. So it's easier to take myself out of the equation altogether. 

But I want to find a happy medium. I don't want to bury myself in crowds nor do I want to isolate myself. My goal right now is to learn how to be like this red tulip: to do my thing simply because it's my thing, even if it means I stand out a bit. I'm pretty sure that it'll bring me joy and I hope that when people see me dancing to a song when no one else is or gushing about a book I've just read that most people have never heard of, it will bring them joy too.
