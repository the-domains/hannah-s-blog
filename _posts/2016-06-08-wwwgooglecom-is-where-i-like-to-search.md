Five ways to live with less and love it

Not long ago I was bit by the simplicity bug. I highly recommend it to anyone feeling overwhelmed or stressed about anything.

My current five favorite ways to simplify are:

1\. Get rid of clothes you don't wear every six months

2\. Use products that can be used for more than one thing

  
My mom calls getting rid of clutter "stuff-ectomy" and it really does feel like removing a useless, even poisonous, thing from your life to to look at a pile of clothes you've purged from your closet or the extra space under your bathroom sink after you've pulled out all the expired products and think, "Look at how much cleaner everything is!"
